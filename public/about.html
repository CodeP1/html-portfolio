<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Heyy there, my self pratik and im aspiring web devloper. this is start of my journey. and want to become
  the professional web devloper who can create amazing web sites for fun or for big enterprizes or for small peoples.
  i want to do it for my self because i love to create new things by my own. it inspire me to do more and more.
</p>

<p>Although im doing it for fun but one day i want to show world that i can create something that can change the world
  and world can recognize me by it. and take inspiration from me. 
</p>

<p>Some people will think web devlopment is hard because it has html, css, bootstrap, javascript 
  and doing web devlopement is time consuming and eventually end up loosing hope and interest
  but what i think is no matter how hard it is you should try it. try to do your best and one day you will be 
surprised to see yourself how far you have come. and that time you will be proud of yourself.
so never give up on your dream. what ever it is. you have to start at some point if you want to acheive it.
so keep hustling and keep coding!!:)</p>
